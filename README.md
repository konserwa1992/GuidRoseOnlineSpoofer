To run this program, you need to add GuidSpoofer.dll to the trose.exe file using the cff explorer program.</br> Then, copy the easyhook and GuidSpoofer files to game folder.

To shortcut add --guid <GUID> 
"--login --server  45.77.221.232 --username <USER> --password <PASSWORD> --guid {6F5AC3D7-3C02-498B-8C06-DFFB8D395F53}

After completing these steps, you can launch multiple clients, and each of them will be treated as a separate machine(spoofed machine guid).
